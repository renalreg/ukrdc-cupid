# Storage Models

Contains *only* class definitions for our storage models, all subclassing `ukrdc_cupid.core.store.models.ukrdc.Node`.

*This may not need to be a whole directory if the models end up in a single file, however I'm structuring like this for now so we have the option to break the models file into smaller, domain-specific files if that ends up being useful.*
