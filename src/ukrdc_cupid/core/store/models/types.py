"""
Functions to add reusable types in the xsd to the models. Currently they are 
mostly either hardcoded or live at the location where they are used. Examples
of these are the address type, the clinician type or the common metadata type.
More generally shouldn't anything with a reusuable type have it's own table in
the ukrdc? Why isn't there an address table?
