# CUPID Investigate

The `investigate` submodule holds any logic relating to the inquiry and resolution of issues throughout the matching and storage process.

This includes (but may not be limited to):

- Raising and resolving matching issues (previously referred to as "Work Items")
  - See our [Confluence docs](https://renalregistry.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SP/pages/2213249114/JTRACE+Replacement#2.3-Work-Item:-Reject-file-for-existing-patient-record) for more information on what this will specifically involve.
- Raising and resolving validation _warnings_
  - This functionality has not yet been confirmed, but warnings raised by future validation rules in the `parse` submodule may be handled here. This is an open discussion.
