# UKRDC XML to SQLAlchemy

A barebones library to convert RDA XML files to UKRDC SQLAlchemy objects

## Status

Very much WIP. Proper docs and tests to come.

### Todo

- [] Finish basic conversion mapping
- [] Add convenience functions to convert an XML file (as opposed to an already-parsed XSData object)
- [] Add tests
- [] Add docs
